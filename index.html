                    I am a software engineer with over 2 years of experience, currently working at VMware. My primary skills include Go, Cloud Foundry, Grafana, Prometheus, and Wavefront. I have a passion for developing high-quality, scalable software solutions, and have gained valuable experience in developing and maintaining observability software applications for the Tanzu Application Service, which is a platform for developing and running modern applications. I have contributed to it through my work on the Healthwatch Team and the VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront Nozzle. In these roles, I have gained experience with debugging and troubleshooting software issues writing and maintaining technical documentation. I am always looking for ways to further develop my skills and contribute to the success of the team

                <h3> FuzzyCalc </h3> <p>
                In my experience as a tutor, I noticed that many students pull out their calculators for simple calculations. Even at the university level, some struggle with basic arithmetic, like 0 * 100 or 15 / 2. Well no longer! FuzzyCalc is a special calculator which helps students get better at math. For every calculation, you must enter an approximation before the calculator will tell you the answer. It's the calculator that only thinks if you do, too!
